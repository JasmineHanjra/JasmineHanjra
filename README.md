👋 Hello! I'm Jasmine Hanjra, a sophomore studying Computer Science at Rutgers University. I'm passionate about technology and the endless possibilities it offers. When I'm not buried in code or textbooks, you can often find me exploring new places and cultures, indulging my love for travel.

🖥️ My journey in the world of Computer Science is an exciting one. I am constantly learning, experimenting, and building new things. This README serves as a glimpse into my coding adventures and the projects I'm working on.

📚 Apart from my technical pursuits, I have a deep appreciation for knowledge and enjoy reading non-fiction books. Whether it's delving into the realms of science, history, or personal development, I believe that learning from the wisdom of others is a never-ending journey.

Feel free to browse through my repositories to see what I've been up to. If you share similar interests or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's connect and explore the exciting world of technology together!
